              Richmond Properties Seeing unprecedented growth among the Filipino
              middle class Ayala Land – from a portfolio of properties that were
              primarily
              <br />
              high-end – expanded its scope to cater to the needs of this
              booming sector. Starting in 1990 with properties in the growth
              corridor south of Metro Manila
              <br />
              Ayala Land’s new division was called Laguna Properties Holdings
              Inc. With LPHI, the company again redefined the property market by
              offering a new range
              <br />
              of options for its customers. With early projects like Santarosa
              Estates in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, , and Hacienda Sta. Monica in
              Batangas, LPHI opened the doors <br />
              toward property ownership for a new generation of Filipinos.
              Taking on a name that embodied a new purpose – “Ave” meaning
              ““Celebrate” and “Vida” meaning <br />
              “Life” <br />– LPHI became Avida Land Corp. in 2006. Starting from
              its developments in Laguna, the company extended its reach to
              other. <br />
              areas and continued to reinvent the real estate segment with its
              mission of making affordable dream communities a reality for
              middle-income Filipinos. <br />
              Serving the need of the Filipino families for a sure, secure, and
              sensible home where they can celebrate life every day is what
              Avida is all about. <br />
